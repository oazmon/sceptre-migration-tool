Feature: Launch environment

  Scenario: launch an environment that does not exist
    Given environment "2" does not exist
    When the user launches environment "2"
    Then all the stacks in environment "2" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"

  Scenario: launch an environment that already exists
    Given all the stacks in environment "2" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"
    When the user launches environment "2"
    Then all the stacks in environment "2" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"

  Scenario: launch an environment that partially exists
    Given stack "2/A" exists in "CREATE_COMPLETE" state
    When the user launches environment "2"
    Then all the stacks in environment "2" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"

  Scenario: launch an environment with updates that partially exists
    Given stack "2/A" exists in "CREATE_COMPLETE" state
    and stack "2/B" does not exist
    and stack "2/C" does not exist
    and the template for stack "2/A" is "updated_template.json"
    When the user launches environment "2"
    Then stack "2/A" exists in "UPDATE_COMPLETE" state
    and stack "2/B" exists in "CREATE_COMPLETE" state
    and stack "2/C" exists in "CREATE_COMPLETE" state

  Scenario: launch an environment with updates that already exists
    Given all the stacks in environment "2" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"
    and the template for stack "2/A" is "updated_template.json"
    and the template for stack "2/B" is "updated_template.json"
    and the template for stack "2/C" is "updated_template.json"
    When the user launches environment "2"
    Then all the stacks in environment "2" are in "UPDATE_COMPLETE"

  Scenario: launch an environment with nested environments that do not exist
    Given environment "5" does not exist
    When the user launches environment "5"
    Then all the stacks in environment "5" are in "CREATE_COMPLETE"
