# Installation

This assumes that you have Python installed. A thorough guide on installing Python can be found [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/). We highly recommend using Sceptre Migration Tool from within a `virtualenv`. Notes on installing and setting up `virtualenv` can be found [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Install Sceptre:

```shell
$ pip install sceptre_migration_tool
```

Validate installation by printing out Sceptre Migration Tool's version number:

```shell
$ sceptre_migration_tool --version
Sceptre Migration Tool, version <x.x.x>
```

Update Sceptre Migration Tool:

```shell
$ pip install sceptre_migration_tool -U
```
